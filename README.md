The code goes through a couple diffrent loops each with thier own indivudual task the first loop going through the missions list adding up the amount of items in the list and outputing the total the seconed loop counts the amount of times succsess is said in the succsess list and outputing the number. then there is a peice of code the takes the two numbers outputed by the two preveious lists and puts them into a math function to caculate the percentage rate on successes. then there is a code that rounds down the percentage.  the final loop in the code takes two lists and puts them together and if anything is before 2000 in the list it will print but the moment it finds one that is it dosesnt print it.
